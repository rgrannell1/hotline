A hotline to sites you need quickly.

This tool eliminates the "chain of click" you make to get to a website's searchbar and directly takes you to the link you're looking for.

## Usage

Create a `.hotline` file

```
- id: github/me
  url: https://github.com/yourname/$0
```

run

```sh
hl github/me your-repo
```

and the page will open in your default browser.
